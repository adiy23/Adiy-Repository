   <h1>Welcome!</h1> 
   <h2>Author: Mohamed Adiy</h2>
   <h4>This is my first attempt at making a website.</h4>
   <p>I've never made a website before, but, my friend, Mohamed Zayaan has. He did a very cool blog where he talked about his hobby.
       <a href="https://myblog2.zayaan0789.repl.co/">Click here to go to Zayaan's blog.</a> One of my favorite things are computers and the
       other is cars.
   </p>
   <h3>These are my favorite cars listed below!</h3>
